## Questions
- should I provide helpful errors if a component might be configured incorrectly (perhaps only enabled when running in dev mode)?
- Mobile support (configurable break points)?
- Maybe remove tailwind?
- could use zod for typechecking with form inputs?
- Add all root styles used in each component to docs?
